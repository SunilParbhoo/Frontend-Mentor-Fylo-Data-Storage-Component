## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned/practiced

This project allowed me to practice various aspects of responsive frontend development with the use of media queries, and allowed me to practice other fun aspects such as use of gradients and pseudo-elements. I also added some hover effects, although these were not part of the original design requirements.
